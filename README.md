# datasetManipulatedBIstudy
I founded this dataset at Kaggle, so i decided to use it to create a dashboard at power b.i, only to study the manipulation of this data through a decision-making dashboard.

dataset updated by RANZEET RAUT at Kaggle, this is a great vision about Cervical Cancer. I think that's amazing to work with the data of this db, because manipulated the final view to ubnderstand de default between the patient victms of desease.

-- so my view its no finished, but i am really happy with it, just the begin hehe, so i tried at DAX ambient to do the formula IF but its not working, i will leave all documents here. Thank you.
